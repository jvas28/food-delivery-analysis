# Food Delivery Dataset Analysis (Python + Pandas)

This project is a data analysis notebook based on a food delivery dataset.  
The goal is to explore customer behavior, restaurant performance, ratings, delivery times, and revenue impact using **Python and Pandas**.

---

## What I did in this analysis

- Loaded and explored the dataset (shape, column types, basic stats)
- Cleaned and prepared key fields (especially the `rating` column)
- Performed **univariate analysis** (distributions and counts)
- Performed **bivariate analysis** (comparisons between variables)
- Performed **multivariate analysis** using pairplots and correlation
- Answered business questions such as:
  - Top cuisines by revenue
  - Restaurants with the longest preparation time
  - Most active customers (highest number of orders)
  - Most popular cuisine on weekends
  - Restaurants eligible for promotional offers based on rating rules
  - Total revenue generated by commission rules
  - Percentage of orders taking more than 60 minutes total

## Dataset columns

- `order_id` (int)
- `customer_id` (int)
- `restaurant_name` (string)
- `cuisine_type` (string)
- `cost_of_the_order` (float)
- `day_of_the_week` (string)
- `rating` (string, includes values like `"Not given"`)
- `food_preparation_time` (int)
- `delivery_time` (int)

Extra features created during the analysis:
- `rating_num` (numeric rating, converted from `rating`)
- `total_time` = `food_preparation_time + delivery_time`
- `is_weekend` (True/False)

## Tools used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Key takeaways

- The dataset has **1898 orders**
- Ratings include `"Not given"`, which should be treated as missing values
- Most orders are in a **mid price range**
- Preparation and delivery times are mostly between **20 and 35 minutes**
- Pairplots and correlations show **no strong linear relationships** between cost, times, and rating
- Restaurants with **high rating count and high average rating** are the best candidates for promotions
- Orders above **$20** generate the highest commission (25%)
